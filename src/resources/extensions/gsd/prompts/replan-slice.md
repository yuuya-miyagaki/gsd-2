## UNIT: Replan Slice {{sliceId}} ("{{sliceTitle}}") — Milestone {{milestoneId}}

## Working Directory

Your working directory is `{{workingDirectory}}`. All file reads, writes, and shell commands MUST operate relative to this directory. Do NOT `cd` to any other directory.

A completed task reported `blocker_discovered: true`, meaning the current slice plan cannot be executed as-is. Your job is to rewrite the remaining tasks in the slice plan to address the blocker while preserving all completed work.

All relevant context has been preloaded below — the roadmap, current slice plan, the blocker task summary, and decisions are inlined. Start working immediately without re-reading these files.

## Capture Context

The following user-captured thoughts triggered or informed this replan:

{{captureContext}}

Consider these captures when rewriting the remaining tasks — they represent the user's real-time insights about what needs to change.

## Hard Constraints

- **Do NOT renumber or remove completed tasks.** All `[x]` tasks and their IDs must remain exactly as they are in the plan.
- **Do NOT change completed task descriptions, estimates, or metadata.** They are historical records.
- **Preserve completed task summaries.** Do not modify any `T0x-SUMMARY.md` files for completed tasks.
- Only modify `[ ]` (incomplete) tasks. You may rewrite, reorder, add, or remove incomplete tasks as needed to address the blocker.
- New tasks must follow the existing ID numbering sequence (e.g., if T01–T03 exist, new tasks start at T04 or continue from the highest existing ID).

## Instructions

1. Read the blocker task summary carefully. Understand exactly what was discovered and why it blocks the current plan.
2. Analyze the remaining `[ ]` tasks in the slice plan. Determine which are still valid, which need modification, and which should be replaced.
3. **Persist replan state through `gsd_replan_slice`.** Call it with: `milestoneId`, `sliceId`, `blockerTaskId`, `blockerDescription`, `whatChanged`, `updatedTasks` (array of task objects with taskId, title, description, estimate, files, verify, inputs, expectedOutput), `removedTaskIds` (array of task ID strings). The tool structurally enforces preservation of completed tasks, writes replan history to the DB, re-renders `{{planPath}}`, and renders `{{replanPath}}`.
4. If any incomplete task had a `T0x-PLAN.md`, remove or rewrite it to match the new task description.
5. Do not commit manually — the system auto-commits your changes after this unit completes.

When done, say: "Slice {{sliceId}} replanned."
